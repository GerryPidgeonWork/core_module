.gitignore for Python Boilerplate Project

This file tells Git which files and folders to intentionally ignore.

CRITICAL: This file is designed to PREVENT you from accidentally committing
sensitive credentials (like 'token.json') or large, unnecessary folders
(like '.venv' or 'dist') to your repository.
