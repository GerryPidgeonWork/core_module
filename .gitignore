.gitignore for Python Boilerplate Project

This file tells Git which files and folders to intentionally ignore.

CRITICAL: This file is designed to PREVENT you from accidentally committing

sensitive credentials (like 'token.json') or large, unnecessary folders

(like '.venv' or 'dist') to your repository.

====================================================================================================

--- Virtual Environment ---

Ignore the entire virtual environment folder.

.venv/
venv/
env/

--- Credentials & Secrets ---

NEVER commit your personal, generated token. This file contains your live login.

credentials/token.json

The 'credentials.json' is your "master key" from Google.

It's better to add this manually on each machine than to commit it.

Uncomment the line below if you agree (recommended).

credentials/credentials.json

Ignore local environment files (if you use them)

.env

--- Python Cache & Logs ---

Ignore all Python bytecode cache folders

pycache/
*.py[cod]

Ignore the log folder

logs/

--- Build & Distribution ---

Ignore all PyInstaller build artifacts

dist/
build/
*.spec

--- OS-specific Junk Files ---

.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

--- IDE-specific Folders ---

.vscode/
.idea/

--- Jupyter Notebook ---

.ipynb_checkpoints
